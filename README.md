### Shiny Gallery ###

The Shiny Gallery contains a wide variety of example applications that demonstrate features and techniques useful to Shiny developers. You can access the gallery at [http://shinygallery.com](http://shinygallery). 

This repository contains the source code for the Gallery website. This code as well as the code for the examples in the gallery are published using the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) to permit broad re-use in both commercial and open-source contexts.

### Contributing to the Gallery ###

Contributions to the Gallery are welcome and encouraged! You can submit a contribution in one of two ways:
 
- Post to the Gallery [issue tracker](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-gallery/issues/new). The issue just needs to include a link to where the application is hosted on the web (the RStudio hosting service [ShinyApps](http://www.shinyapps.io/signup.html) is a good choice for this).

- Fork and clone the Gallery repository, import your application (see below for details), then send us a pull request.

In either case, there are a few guidelines that contributions should meet:

1. They should clearly demonstrate one or two concepts or techniques with a minimum of additional scaffolding code.

2. Source code should be formatted at a width of no more than 65 characters (to facilitate side-by-side viewing of code and application).

3. They should include a `DESCRIPTION` file with metadata about the application and a `Readme.md` file with a short (2 or 3 sentence) description of the application. 

Here's an example `DESCRIPTION` file:

```yaml
Version: 1.0
Type: ShinyShowcase
Title: Hello Shiny!
Author: RStudio, Inc.
AuthorUrl: http://www.rstudio.com/
License: MIT
Tags: getting-started
DefaultShowcaseMode: 1
```

The Gallery takes advantage of a new feature of Shiny called showcase mode which displays applications along with their source code. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Showcase mode is currently available only on a development branch of Shiny. To install this version of Shiny:

```r
devtools::install("rstudio/shiny", ref = "feature/showcase-mode")
```

The `DefaultShowcaseMode` entry ensures that your application can be run in showcase mode. To preview your application in showcase mode locally you can do this:

```r
runApp(showcase = TRUE)
```

Alternatively you can append `showcase=1` to the application query string.


### Importing an Application ###

If you want to submit a contribution as a pull request rather than an issue, you'll need to fork and clone this repository and then import your application using the Gallery import utility. This section provides detailed on instructions on how to do this.

#### Installing Dependencies ####

To run the Shiny Gallery locally you need to be on Linux or Mac OS X. You also need to install some dependencies. These dependencies include several Ruby libraries. To isolate these libraries from others on your system it's strongly recommended that you first install [RVM](https://rvm.io/) (Ruby Version Manager).

Once you've installed RVM you should execute the following from the root directory of the repository: 

```bash
$ _dependencies/install
```

This script installs the Ruby bundles [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [gist](http://defunkt.io/gist/), the R [downloader](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/downloader/index.html) package, as well as the [phantom.js](http://phantomjs.org/) utility (which is used for capturing thumbnails of Shiny applications).

#### Performing the Import ####

To import an application you run the `import` utility, providing the URL of the application as a command line parameter. For example:

```bash
$ ./import.R http://gallery.shinyapps.io/animated-slider
```

The import script will download the application's `DESCRIPTION` file, verify that it has the required entries, and generate a thumbnail of the application using phantom.js. Note that you can also provide your own thumbnail by including a file named `thumbnail.png` in the application's directory (thumbnail dimensions should be approximately 910x660 pixels).

If all goes well then two files will be generated by the import. For example:

```
_posts/2013-12-20-animiated-slider.md
images/thumbnails/2013-12-20-animiated-slider.png
```

#### Source Code Gist ####

In addition to adding a link to your applicaiton to the Gallery, the import utility will also create a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) containing your application's source code. By default, the files ui.R, server.R, global.R will be included in the gist if they exist. If you want to include additional files you should add them explicitly using a `Sources` entry in the `DESCRIPTION` file. For example:

```yaml
Sources: 
  utils.R
  data.R
```

The gist is created using the Ruby gist gem, which by default creates an anonymous gist. If you'd like to link the gist to your own Github account then login to Github [as described here](http://defunkt.io/gist/#Login) before running the import utility.

#### Previewing Your Changes ####

After you've imported your application you'll want to run the Gallery locally to preview the changes. To do this you can execute the following from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
$ jekyll serve --watch
```

This will run a local web server that can be accessed at `http://localhost:4000`. Note that the `--watch` parameter is included so that the website is automatically rebuilt when files changes, so if you re-run your import you need only refresh the browser as opposed to stopping and restarting the local web server.
