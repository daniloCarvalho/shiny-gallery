### Shiny Example Application Gallery ###

The example application gallery demonstrates many features and techniques useful to Shiny developers. 

### Running the Gallery Locally ###

To run the Shiny Gallery locally you need to be on Linux or Mac OS X. You also need to install several dependencies. The dependencies include the Ruby libraries required to run [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). To isloate these Ruby libraries from others on your system it's strongly recommended that you first install [RVM](https://rvm.io/) (Ruby Version Manager).

Once you've installed RVM you should execute the following from the root directory of the repository: 

```bash
$ _scripts/install-dependencies
```

This script installs both Jekyll and phantom.js (used for capturing thumbnails of Shiny applications).
